//! Per-window store for retained record payloads. Owned by `WindowRenderer`,
//! with a cheap `Rc` clone held by its `Ui` for record-time mesh / polyline /
//! formatting writes. Later CPU and GPU phases borrow that window's payloads
//! explicitly.
//! Cleared at record-pass start and retained across `PaintOnly` frames.
//!
//! Replaces the previous three-step copy (user `Mesh` →
//! `Tree.shapes.payloads` → `RenderCmdBuffer.shape_payloads` →
//! `RenderBuffer.meshes`) with a single retained payload store. Shape records on
//! the tree, payloads on the cmd buffer, and `MeshDraw` entries on the
//! render buffer all carry spans into this storage directly.
//!
//! This file is storage only: the authoring `Shape` → `ShapeRecord` /
//! `ChromeRow` lowering that appends here lives in
//! [`crate::forest::shapes::lower`].
