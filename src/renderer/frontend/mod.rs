//! Frontend (CPU) rendering pipeline.
//!
//! 1. [`Encoder`] — `&Tree` → [`RenderCmdBuffer`](cmd_buffer::RenderCmdBuffer)
//!    (logical-px). Owns the command output and encode scratch.
//! 2. [`Composer`] — `&RenderCmdBuffer` → `RenderBuffer` (physical-px
//!    quads + scissor groups). Owns the output + scratch; no GPU handles.
//! 3. [`Frontend`] (this struct) — orchestrates (1) + (2) and owns every
//!    persistent per-frame allocation. [`WindowDriver`] calls [`Frontend::build`]
//!    once per frame and hands the composed buffer to the backend; the
//!    backend reads its own clone of `RenderAssets` (image registry +
//!    gradient atlas) for upload.
//!
//! Output crosses into the backend as `&RenderBuffer` (defined one
//! level up so it sits at the frontend↔backend contract line).
//!
//! [`WindowDriver`]: crate::host::window_driver::WindowDriver
