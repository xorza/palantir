//! Frontend (CPU) rendering pipeline.
//!
//! 1. [`encode`] — `&Tree` → `Vec<RenderCmd>` (logical-px). Pure free fn.
//! 2. [`Composer`] — `&[RenderCmd]` → `RenderBuffer` (physical-px quads
//!    + scissor groups). Owns the output + scratch; no GPU handles.
//! 3. [`Frontend`] (this struct) — orchestrates (1) + (2) and owns every
//!    persistent per-frame allocation. `Ui::end_frame` calls
//!    [`Frontend::build`] once and pulls the painted output via
//!    [`FrameOutput`].
//!
//! Output crosses into the backend as `&RenderBuffer` (defined one
//! level up so it sits at the frontend↔backend contract line).
