//! Layout-side scroll subsystem. Owns:
//!
//! - **Driver** ([`measure`] + [`arrange`]) — minimal: INF-axis
//!   measure that records the content extent into the matching
//!   [`ScrollLayoutState`] row, and a standard arrange that updates
//!   the layout-derived fields (viewport, overflow, seen) and
//!   re-clamps `offset` post-arrange. No separate post-pass — the
//!   driver is the refresh.
//! - **Cross-frame state** ([`ScrollLayoutState`]) — offset, viewport,
//!   content, overflow, seen — keyed by the inner viewport node's
//!   `WidgetId` on [`LayoutEngine::scroll_states`]. The scroll widget
//!   reads and mutates this directly (via [`Ui::scroll_state`], which
//!   applies the same `.with("__viewport")` hop transparently).
//!
//! Bar-gutter reservation and bar drawing live in
//! [`crate::widgets::scroll`] — the layout primitive itself is
//! unaware of scrollbars and of the outer ZStack the widget wraps it
//! in.

// Cross-frame state — what the scroll widget reads at record time
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Cross-frame state row for one scroll widget. Owned by
/// [`LayoutEngine::scroll_states`] — *not* `StateMap`, because this
/// is a layout-derived concern (the driver writes layout fields) and
/// belongs in the layout subsystem rather than tangled with widget
/// state.
///
/// The widget at record time:
/// - Reads the snapshot via [`Ui::scroll_state`](crate::Ui::scroll_state)
///   for offset clamp + reservation guess + bar geometry.
/// - Mutates `offset` from input (via the same entry).
///
/// The driver writes layout-derived fields:
/// - `measure` records `content` (the bbox `Rect`, including any
///   negative `min` rolled up from a child canvas).
/// - `arrange` records `viewport` (inner rect post user-padding),
///   `overflow`, and `seen`. No offset clamp — see the note in
///   `arrange`.
///
/// - `offset` — input-accumulated pan position (next frame's start).
/// - `viewport` — INNER (user-padding-deflated) size: what children
///   see. Drives `content.size > viewport` overflow checks.
/// - `outer` — full arranged rect size of the scroll node including
///   any reservation gutter. Drives bar positioning so the bar sits
///   flush with the OUTER far edge. Parent-allocated and stable
///   across reservation flips (unlike `viewport`, which shrinks when
///   a gutter appears) — that's why we store it instead of deriving
///   from `viewport + padding + reservation` at record time.
/// - `content` — measured bbox `Rect` of the inner content in
///   scroll-content coords. `content.min` (≤ `(0,0)`) is the
///   leading-edge offset rolled up from a direct child canvas;
///   `content.size = content.max - content.min`. Read by the widget
///   for clamp range and bar geometry.
/// - `overflow` — `(x, y)` per-axis: did `content.size * zoom`
///   exceed `viewport`? Read at record time to decide whether to
///   reserve a bar gutter on the cross axis.
/// - `seen` — set true by `arrange` after the first frame. Read by
///   the widget to detect a cold-mount and trigger a relayout pass
///   so pass B records with the measured reservation in place.
