//! Off-target wake gates + unified pointer event stream.
//!
//! [`Subscriptions`] holds two pieces of state — both cleared
//! pre-record, both re-asserted by widgets each frame they're
//! active (symmetric to `Sense` on a node):
//!
//! 1. [`Subscriptions::any_mask`] — category flags ([`PointerSense`])
//!    answering "does this event class wake the frame?"
//! 2. [`Subscriptions::keys`] — specific `(Key, Modifiers)` chords for
//!    modal Escape / command-palette shortcuts.
//!
//! Across silent (PaintOnly / skipped) frames the set **persists** —
//! that's the wake signal: a dormant popup needs `BUTTONS`
//! to still be set when the next click outside lands.
//!
//! Delivery isn't routed through subscriptions. Pointer events flow
//! into [`InputState::frame_pointer_events`](super::InputState),
//! keys into [`InputState::frame_keys`](super::InputState). Both
//! buffers are populated only when a relevant subscription is active
//! (the `any_mask` check short-circuits the push), so idle frames
//! pay nothing.
