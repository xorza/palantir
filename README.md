# Palantir Project

Palantir is an R&D Rust-based GUI library designed to be performant, cross-platform, and purely reliant on the Rust compiler without external dependencies. It features a clean, declarative API, similar in style to modern frameworks like SwiftUI, leveraging minimal macro usage for improved readability and maintainability.
