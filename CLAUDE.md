# Palantir

A Rust GUI crate. **Immediate-mode authoring API**, **WPF-style two-pass layout**, **wgpu rendering**.

Read `DESIGN.md` for the full design rationale before making non-trivial changes.

## Core architecture

Five passes per frame:

1. **Record** — user code (`Button::new().label("x").show(&mut ui)`) appends per-node columns (`LayoutCore`, `PaintCore`, `WidgetId`, `subtree_end`) and `Shape`s into an arena `Tree`. No painting yet.
2. **Measure** — post-order. Each node returns desired size given available size.
3. **Arrange** — pre-order. Parent assigns final `Rect` to each child.
4. **Cascade** — pre-order. `Cascades::rebuild` resolves disabled/invisible/clip/transform per node into a flat table; consumed by both encoder and hit-index so they can't drift.
5. **Encode + Paint** — pre-order. `renderer::encode` walks the tree → `Vec<RenderCmd>`; `Composer` groups by scissor and snaps to physical pixels; `WgpuBackend` submits instanced quad draws.

The tree is rebuilt every frame; widget *state* (scroll, focus, animation) lives in a separate `Id → Any` map keyed by `WidgetId` (hashed call-site/user key) — *not yet implemented*.

### Node columns vs Shape — the key split

Per-node data is stored as parallel SoA columns on `Tree`, all indexed by `NodeId.0`:

- **`Tree.layout: Vec<LayoutCore>`** — mode, size, padding, margin, align, visibility. Read by measure/arrange/alignment math.
- **`Tree.paint: Vec<PaintCore>`** — `PaintAttrs` (sense/disabled/clip, packed in 1 byte) + extras index. Read by cascade/encoder/hit-test.
- **`Tree.widget_ids: Vec<WidgetId>`** — read only by hit-test and (future) state map.
- **`Tree.subtree_end: Vec<u32>`** — pre-order topology; `i + 1 == subtree_end[i]` for a leaf. Read by every walk.

Splitting by reader keeps each pass touching only the columns it needs. Measured size (`desired`, `rect`) lives on `LayoutResult` keyed by `NodeId`, not on the tree.

- **`Shape`** = paint primitive (`RoundedRect`, `Text`, `Line`, …). Stored flat in `Tree.shapes`, sliced per-node via `Tree.shape_starts` (length `node_count() + 1`, so node `i`'s shapes are `shapes[shape_starts[i]..shape_starts[i+1]]`). `RoundedRect` always paints the owner's full arranged rect — no per-shape positioning today.

Layout passes ignore Shapes and `PaintCore`; paint pass ignores hierarchy beyond walking `subtree_end`. This decoupling is load-bearing — keep it.

### Sizing semantics (WPF-aligned)

- `Sizing::Fixed(n)` — outer dimension is exactly `n` (includes padding).
- `Sizing::Hug` — outer dimension = content + padding (WPF's `Auto`).
- `Sizing::Fill(weight)` — take available space, distribute leftover by weight across `Fill` siblings (WPF's `*`).

`resolve_axis_size` in `src/layout/mod.rs` is the canonical implementation; `src/layout/{stack,zstack,canvas,grid}/tests.rs` pin it.

### Tree topology

Pre-order arena: nodes are stored in pre-order paint order, so node `i`'s children start at `i + 1` and its whole subtree spans `i..subtree_end[i]`. To iterate direct children, jump from `i + 1` past each child's own `subtree_end` until reaching the parent's. No `parent` / `first_child` / `next_sibling` links — `subtree_end` (4 bytes per node) is the only topology field. Inspired by Clay (`tmp/clay`) and `indextree`. `Tree::push_node` is O(depth): it appends the new node and walks up the ancestor chain bumping each ancestor's `subtree_end`.

## Reference notes in `./references/`

29 dense per-framework notes plus a cross-cutting synthesis. **Read `references/SUMMARY.md` first** — it indexes every other doc, takes positions on the design choices Palantir must make, and lists anti-patterns + open questions across the corpus. Each per-framework doc cites source code under `tmp/` with `file:line` and ends with explicit copy/avoid/simplify recommendations for Palantir.

Use the SUMMARY's "Quick-lookup matrix" (§13) to find which docs to read for a given task (HStack semantics, text widget, hit-testing, persistent state, etc.).

## Reference sources in `./tmp/`

`./tmp/` is gitignored and populated on demand by `./scripts/fetch-refs.sh` (shallow clones, re-runnable). The `references/*.md` notes already digest these — go to `tmp/` only when a note doesn't cover the specific question.

Most relevant when working on:

- **Layout / measure-arrange** → `tmp/wpf` (the model we emulate), `tmp/taffy`, `tmp/morphorm`, `tmp/yoga`, `tmp/clay` (arena tree)
- **Immediate-mode patterns** → `tmp/egui`, `tmp/imgui`, `tmp/clay`, `tmp/nuklear`
- **wgpu renderer / batching** → `tmp/egui` (`crates/egui-wgpu`), `tmp/iced` (`wgpu` crate), `tmp/quirky`, `tmp/vello`, `tmp/wgpu`
- **Text** → `tmp/glyphon`, `tmp/cosmic-text`, `tmp/parley`
- **Vector shapes** → `tmp/lyon`, `tmp/kurbo`, `tmp/vello`
- **Reactive / retained Rust UIs for contrast** → `tmp/iced`, `tmp/xilem`, `tmp/dioxus`, `tmp/floem`, `tmp/slint`, `tmp/makepad`

If the directory is missing or stale, run the script before doing research:
```sh
./scripts/fetch-refs.sh
```

When you need to look up a dependency's API (signatures, version-specific
behavior, internal types), grep `tmp/<crate>/src` first — that source is at
the same version Palantir builds against and is faster than `cargo doc`. Only
fall back to `~/.cargo/registry/src/...` if the crate isn't listed in
`fetch-refs.sh`.

## Conventions

- Early-stage project. No external users, no published API. Prefer correctness, simplicity, and structural improvements over preserving the current API shape — rename, restructure, or break things freely when it makes the code better. Don't add deprecation shims, compatibility aliases, or migration helpers.
- No comments except for non-obvious *why*. Code is short and self-explanatory; keep it that way.
- Default to release `assert!` for invariant checks, not `debug_assert!` — `debug_assert!` is stripped in release and hides logic bugs in the build users actually run. Reserve `debug_assert!` for checks that are genuinely too expensive for release (e.g. O(n) inside a hot loop), and call out the tradeoff when choosing it.
- Edition 2024. Dependencies pinned to `*` for now (lockfile pins actual versions) — fine for prototype, pin before publishing.
- Tests in `lib.rs` pin layout semantics. Add a test whenever you change measure/arrange behavior.
- Don't add wgpu code paths to the layout/tree modules. Renderer goes in its own module when written.
- `WidgetId` is built from a hash of a user-supplied key. Keep IDs stable across frames so persistent state survives.
- Widget constructors that auto-derive ids (`Button::new`, `Text::new`, etc.) use `WidgetId::auto_stable()` + `#[track_caller]` so two calls at different source lines get distinct ids. **`#[track_caller]` does not propagate through closure bodies** — if a helper function builds widgets inside a closure passed to e.g. `Panel::show(ui, |ui| { ... })`, every call site of the helper resolves the inner widget's location to the closure literal, producing colliding ids. Inside helpers that build widgets through closures, give those widgets explicit ids (`Text::with_id((tag, key), text)`, `Button::with_id(...)`). Annotating the helper with `#[track_caller]` doesn't help — the closure breaks the chain.
- Treat all docs (`docs/*.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `references/*`) as evolving and possibly wrong. They may lag the code or encode decisions that have been re-litigated. When a doc statement contradicts the user's intent or current code, double-question rather than deferring — flag the conflict, ask the user, and update the doc to reflect the resolution. Documented decisions are starting positions, not commitments; re-evaluate when context changes.

## Before reporting work as done

Always run, in this order, before confirming any code change:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Fix anything that fails. Don't tell the user a change is complete unless these all pass.

## Finding duplicated code

Before refactoring or hunting for similar code by reading files, run jscpd — it's fast (~500ms) and avoids burning tokens:

```sh
npm_config_cache="$TMPDIR/npm-cache" npx --yes jscpd src/ --min-lines 5 --min-tokens 50 --ignore "**/tests.rs,**/tests/**" --reporters console
```

Drop the `--ignore` to include tests. Reports exact `file:line` ranges for each clone pair.

## Layout vocabulary (decided)

The committed native panel set is **`HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`,
`Canvas`, and `Grid`**. Step B/C in `docs/intrinsics.md` extends `Grid`
and `H/VStack` to be intrinsic-aware. After that the native set is "done"
for the foreseeable future.

Open future decision (deferred until first concrete user demand): whether
richer flex/grid features arrive via Taffy as an opt-in feature flag
(α — corpus-preferred), Taffy replacing native Grid (β), Taffy replacing
both Stack flex and Grid (γ), or hand-grown in-tree (δ). Until that
trigger, native panels are the authoring surface; Stack flex stops at
"min-floor + weight + max-size" and any feature beyond it triggers the
α/β/γ/δ conversation, not "add a case to `stack::measure`". See
`docs/intrinsics.md` "Future direction" for context.
